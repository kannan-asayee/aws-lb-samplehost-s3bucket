# AWS-loadbalancer-EC2-S3-Buckets

Automated Real-time Infrastructure Setup with Terraform!

This is DevOps project where I automated the entire setup of a real-time infrastructure on AWS using Terraform. 

1.Created a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):
Set up a robust network infrastructure with VPC, subnets, route table and an internet gateway to ensure secure and scalable connectivity. 

2.Implemented Security Measures:
Crafted security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic, allowing HTTP and SSH access while maintaining a high level of security. 

3.Instances in the Cloud:
Launched EC2 instances for web servers, distributing the workload across multiple availability zones for enhanced reliability and performance. 

4.Object Storage with S3:
Established an S3 bucket for storing and retrieving web assets efficiently, providing a seamless experience for end-users.

5.Load Balancing for High Availability:
Introduced an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to evenly distribute traffic among EC2 instances, ensuring high availability and optimal performance.

6.Automated Deployment with User Data:
Utilized Terraforms capabilities to automate the deployment process, including user data scripts for configuring instances dynamically. 

7.Connectivity:
Connected the dots with route tables, ensuring seamless communication between different components and allowing internet access for the web servers.
